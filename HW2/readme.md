In general, no extra packages are needed for installation, but if you need a custom package that doesn't come with your python version,
it is recommended to use conda: https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-conda.html

Follow the instructions to install conda. Then you can use conda to set up various environments that can use a specific version of python and other packages.
Generally, you should make a new environment for each new project you are working on, but for this class, you can probably keep it all in one environment.
